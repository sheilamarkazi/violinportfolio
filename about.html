    <h1 class="maincontentheader">About Me</h1>
    <p class="maincontent">I am a fiddle player and an engineer-turned-luthier. I'm inspired by the places I go and the people I meet. I'm interested in how you live and the songs you sing.</p>
    <p class="maincontent">Being drawn to lutherie was natural and inescapable for me. Of course, I had grown up playing the violin and music was well-loved in my home. I grew up in a multi-cultural, tri-lingual household, so I was exposed to many sounds and  kinds of music. My family lives on a small farm in Illinois and I  was raised to appreciate the natural world and to being accustomed to working with it. This appreciation fed a passion for understanding the mechanics of how the world works and how we build our niche within it. Pursuing my curiosity, I graduated with degrees in Civil Engineering and  Biology from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. </p>
    <p class="maincontent">After college, I chased opportunities and musical excitement throughout the Western part of the United States, living for a time in Montana, Seattle, and Salt Lake City. I was most inspired by the people I met who were reimagining, revitalizing, challenging and developing their communities. With their insight, I refined my perspective on how people build their environment. To get to the communities we want to live in, we build not just bridges and roads, we build cultures. Culture is a gift from our heritage, and we can continue to cultivate it every day if we pursue art and science that exalts us.</p>
    <p class="maincontent">In time, music became my most sophisticated way of contributing to my community. I play with others as often as possible, in jams as well as venues. I travel to festivals and I teach lessons. Eventually, I sought to bring the mechanical aspects of engineering back into my life and realized that lutherie was the perfect meeting of all my pursuits.</p>
    <p class="maincontent"> I found myself working in a Seattle shop for a year, getting a survey of the field and working on Seattle's largest rental fleet of student instruments. I've had short study excursions with luthiers, and I completed a year of study at the Violin Making School of America. Now, I am learning under Joseph A. Thrift in Mount Airy, NC. This area in North Carolina is also home to Round Peak old-time music, and I feel very fortunate to be able to study this music and culture at its source.</p>

        <p class="maincontent">I enjoy teaching people of all ages and walks of life, and I enjoy teaching fiddle styles as well as a classical foundation.  Please reach out to me via my Contact page - we can chat and quickly get you started learning material that engages you.</p>
    <p class="maincontent">In addition to private lessons, I am seasoned in instructing children and young adults in group settings and under a variety of timetables.  I have taught in after-school programs (Leschi Elementary School via Seattle Music Partners, Washington Middle School via The Rhapsody Project) that run twice a week for the duration of the school year.  Festivals I have taught at include Wintergrass Music Festival and Centrum Foundation's Festival of American Fiddle Tunes. I believe that a well-rounded violin/fiddle education includes a survey of repertoire, jams, music theory, improvisation ear training, cultural history, and efficient violin technique.  I am eager to delve into any or all of these subjects with my students.-->
